### This Version of Anglerphish includes:
- **Per-Campaign URL Parameters:** Allows unique URL parameters per campaign instead of a global `rid`.
- **Additional Group Variable:** Introduces `{{.Custom}}` for use in emails, landing pages, and attachments.
- **Campaign Summary Before Launching**: Provides a summarized overview of all configured parameters (targets, templates, landing pages, etc.) before launching the campaign to avoid misconfiguration.
- **Group Export:** Supports exporting user groups to `.csv` for easy backup and editing.
- **Reported Phishing Monitoring Enhancement:** Improved handling of reported phishing emails, now recognizing all variations of URL parameters across active campaigns.
- **Non-Campaign Reports Page:** Dedicated view for reported emails in the IMAP inbox that are unrelated to any Gophish campaign.
- **X-Tracked Header Handling:** Supports custom `POST` request containing the header `X-Tracked`.
  - When such a `POST` is made to the Anglerphish server, the system parses the parameters in the URL and generates a `.csv` log entry.
  - Example use cases: 
    - Macro-enabled `.doc` or `.xls` files that can‚Äôt be tracked directly through traditional campaigns..
    - Custom `POST` requests triggered by landing pages.
- **QR Code Generator:** Built-in tool to generate QR codes.
- **Default Landing Page:** A default Error 404 landing when visiting the domain based on [edermi/gophish_mods](https://github.com/edermi/gophish_mods/tree/master).
- **HTTP Basic Auth Landing Pages:** Enables basic authentication landing page campaigns based on [edermi/gophish_mods](https://github.com/edermi/gophish_mods/tree/master).
- **QR Code Embedding in Campaigns:** Integrates QR code campaigns, based on [Evil-Gophish](https://github.com/fin3ss3g0d/evilgophish.git).
- **Sneaky Tweaks:** Implements the sneaky gophish tweaks based on the [article](https://www.sprocketsecurity.com/resources/never-had-a-bad-day-phishing-how-to-set-up-gophish-to-evade-security-controls).

### Anglerphish Full Version Features include:
**All the above features plus,** 
- **Campaign Sets:** Introduced the Campaign Sets feature, enabling the creation and configuration of multiple campaigns simultaneously. Users can save these campaigns as drafts, make modifications as needed, and launch them all at once.
- **SMS Campaigns:** Added support for SMS-based campaigns alongside email. Includes dedicated SMS profiles (Twilio and Vonage) and SMS template creation.
- **Additional Group Variable:** Introduced `{{.Phone}}` as a group variable to support SMS messaging.
- **Multiple IMAP Configurations:** Supports adding and managing multiple IMAP server profiles instead of being limited to a single configuration.
  - Additionally two types of Configurations are supported Email Replied and Email Reported.
- **Email Replied:** Tracks when users reply to phishing emails (with additional chart in campaigns) ‚Äî recognizing that replies can also result in sensitive data disclosure, not just clicks or form submissions.
- **Reports Page:** New reporting feature to export campaign results and metrics as Word or Excel files, with Privacy Options to anonymize results.
- **Preview Templates / Landing Pages**: Added the ability to preview Email, SMS, and Landing Page Templates directly‚Äîno need to open the editor.
- **Dashboard Filtering:** Allows filtering the campaign list on the dashboard to show only Email or only SMS campaigns.
